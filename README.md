# Python-Name-Statistics
Python project that displays graphs of statistics regarding the names of American babies born within a user-defined timeframe. Uses data from the Social Security Administration.

Instructions:

Place the included .py file and .txt files for each year together in the same directory.

Run Hunt Name Statistics.py and follow the text prompts. If asked for a gender, enter Male or Female.

After the prompts have been answered, the program will run, compiling all the information of the included files within the user-defined timeframe into a series of DataFrames and using them to generate graphs that showcase certain statistics regarding naming trends.

Please keep in mind that the running time of the program can vary significantly depending on the beginning and ending years selected, with larger timeframes taking commensurately longer to process. For example, evaluating names between 1900 and 1905 will not take as long as evaluating between 1900 and 1980. Larger timeframes spanning most or all of the text files may take several minutes to process.

The program will generate two sets of graphs upon successful completion.

This program requires the following Python libraries:

-NumPy
-pandas
-Matplotlib
